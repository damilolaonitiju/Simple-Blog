                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <p class="details">Summer is the perfect time to refresh your wardrobe and embrace new fashion trends.
                    Whether you're headed to the beach, a barbecue, or just enjoying a sunny day, our summer style guide
                    has you covered.</p>

                <h2>1. Light and Breathable Fabrics</h2>
                <p>When the temperature rises, the key to staying comfortable is choosing light and breathable fabrics.
                    Cotton, linen, and chambray are excellent choices for summer attire. These materials allow air to
                    circulate and keep you cool throughout the day.</p>

                <h2>2. Vibrant Colors and Prints</h2>
                <p>Summer is the season to experiment with bold colors and fun prints. From tropical florals to
                    geometric patterns, adding a splash of color to your outfit can instantly elevate your summer look.
                    Don't be afraid to mix and match prints for a playful ensemble.</p>

                <h2>3. Essential Summer Accessories</h2>
                <p>No summer outfit is complete without the right accessories. Sunglasses, wide-brimmed hats, and
                    lightweight scarves can not only enhance your style but also provide protection from the sun. A
                    stylish tote bag is perfect for carrying your summer essentials.</p>

                <h2>4. Footwear for Every Occasion</h2>
                <p>Choosing the right footwear is crucial for summer. Sandals and espadrilles are great for casual
                    outings, while wedges and heeled sandals can dress up your look for more formal events. Always opt
                    for comfortable shoes that will keep your feet happy all day long.</p>

                <h2>5. Swimwear Trends</h2>
                <p>Whether you prefer one-piece swimsuits or bikinis, there are plenty of stylish swimwear options to
                    choose from this summer. High-waisted bottoms, cut-out details, and vibrant colors are all trending
                    this season. Don't forget to accessorize with a chic cover-up for when you're out of the water.</p>

                <h2>Conclusion</h2>
                <p>With these tips, you'll be ready to embrace the summer in style. Remember to have fun with your
                    wardrobe and express your personality through your outfits. Happy summer!</p>
